Why are the T1, T2 etc in array brackets you ask? If the expression on the left hand side of an extends operator
in a conditional type is a naked type (not an array, object, other type function, etc) then the transpiler
treats it as a "distributive conditional type", which is a complicated concept but in brief it means that
if Foo<T> evaluates to Bar<T>, then Foo<T | U> will evaluate to Bar<T> | Bar<U> i.e. the type function is
distributed over unions. To turn this behavior off, enclose the type expressions in either array or
object notation.

This was a fancy type trick I am proud of. This type function determines the intersection type of all dependencies
of all commands, so it ensures that when processing a command, you are passing the command processor all dependencies
that could be needed by any command processor.

I went to all this trouble because otherwise this class was hard/impossible to unit test. It is a composer so it
should be unit tested, but it was taking in the world of dependencies even if it was composing all command handlers
that didn't need them. So I had to construct crap like IO and a file system that the unit test never used nor
should this unit depend on anyway.

So, command handlers now declare their dependency requirements in their types, SingleCommandHandler<Deps>.
And the intersection of all handlers' dependencies is that the top level composite expects.
